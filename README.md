# interview-elevator

Assumptions:
    * Passengers won't enter a destination that is not supported (this would be fixed later with a choice of floors instead of an integer input).
    * Floors start at 0 and go up. 
    
Features to be implemented:
    * Elevators don't currently have a capacity limit.
    * There is no case that results in an elevator going out of order.
